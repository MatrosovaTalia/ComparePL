# Benchmarking tool for programming language comparison

## Usage (Docker)

<b>Note:</b> Docker must be installed on your system

### Execution

- Run ```./run.sh```

### Adding new languages

- Use this template for a Dockerfile (<b>In different directory, do not change Dockerfile for this project!!!</b>) to install all required packages on image: 
```Dockerfile 
FROM picroc/lang_driver:0.2

# RUN ALL INSTALLATION COMMANDS HERE
```
- Build and tag your new image:
```docker build -t <yourDockerHubRepo>/<imageName>:<imageVersion> .```
- Push built image to DockerHub:
```docker push <yourDockerHubRepo>/<imageName>:<imageVersion>```
- Update image in project's Dockerfile (change ```FROM <image>``` statement at the beggining of the file)
- As a temporary solution, you may add installation steps directly to the project's Dockerfile, but it is recommended to use published images
